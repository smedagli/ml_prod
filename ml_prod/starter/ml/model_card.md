# Model card

## Model details

The model uses categorical and numerical features to predict whether the salary is <= or > 50k.

### Categorical features
* workclass
* education
* marital-status
* occupation
* relationship
* race
* sex
* native-country

### Numerical features
* age
* education_num
* capital_gain
* capital_loss
* fnlgt
* hours_per_week

### Label (to predict)
* salary
  * 0 --> salary <= 50k
  * 1 --> salary > 50k

## Intended use

### Model training
to train the model run
```commandline
python -m ml_prod.starter.train_model
```
the script will write the performance of the model (see details below) in the folder `ml_prod/data/performance`,
and will also save the feature encoders in `ml_prod/model`.
The encoders strongly depend on the method to encode categorical features.

The method to encode categorical features can be specified with the option -e
(by default is set to "OHE" for One Hot Encoding).

Alternatively "LE" (Label Encoder) can be used.
This was the first way to encode labels tested and was kept as "legacy". 

The trained model will be saved as `ml_prod/model/model.pkl`.


### Inference
To predict the values on the test set run the script `train_model` with option `-t`
```commandline
python -m ml_prod.starter.train_model -t
```
the script will write the performance of the model (see details below) in the folder `ml_prod/data/performance`.

Since the script will load the feature encoders automatically from `ml_prod/model`,
it is important to specify the `-e` option according to the latest encoding used in training phase.


## Dataset
The complete dataset can be found in `ml_prod/data/census.csv`

### Training data and Evaluation data
Training and test data split are generated with `from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split`.  
See `starter.train_model.py` at line 81
```python
train_df, test_df = train_test_split(data_, test_size=0.20, random_state=42)  # split dataset
```

## Metrics
Model performance are evaluated via different metrics, mainly:
* accuracy
* recall (sensitivity)
* precision (positive predictive value)
* specificity
* f1 score
* negative predictive value
* true negatives (tn)
* true positives (tp)
* false negatives (fn)
* false positives (fp)

Details about model performance on train and test datasets are provided in `ml_prod/data/performance`

### Confusion matrices
`train_confusion_matrix.csv` and `test_confusion_matrix.csv` report the confusion matrices computed on train and test 
set.

To read a confusion matrix
```python
               true positives              false positives
               false negatives             true negatives
```
To obtain additional information about the confusion matrices,
use the class `BinaryConfusionMatrix` defined in `ml_prod.starter.common`
to easily the metrics defined in the previous section.

### Data slices
In `ml_prod/data/performance` are also provided performance computed on data slices.  
The standard filename is
```commandline
<dataset>_<feature>_slice.csv
```
where `<dataset>` can be `test` or `train`.  
`<feature>` represents the feature on which the data is sliced.
The file includes all the metrics computed on each category of the selected feature.

#### Example:
The feature `sex` includes categories `male` and `female`.
Here is the example file `test_sex_slice.csv`
```csv

    Category  accuracy  recall  precision  sensitivity  specificity  f1_score  negative_predictive_value  positive_predictive_value    tn   tp   fn  fp
0     female      0.90    0.29       0.53         0.29         0.97      0.37                       0.92                       0.53  1923   65  162  57
1       male      0.77    0.27       0.78         0.27         0.97      0.41                       0.76                       0.78  2959  343  909  95
